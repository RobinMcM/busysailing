That’s a great question — 1mind.com is a conversational AI platform that features a lifelike talking avatar, and recreating something similar involves several moving parts (web, AI, and 3D/avatar rendering).
Let’s break down how you can create a website similar to 1mind.com with the avatar hosted locally (not streamed):

🧱 1. Key Components You’ll Need
To build a site like 1mind.com, you need:
ComponentPurposeExample TechFrontend UIWebpage with chat interface and avatar viewportReact, Next.js, or SvelteAvatar rendering3D or 2D model that speaks & animatesThree.js, Babylon.js, or Ready Player Me avatarVoice synthesis (TTS)Converts AI text responses to speechLocal TTS model (e.g. Coqui TTS)Speech recognition (optional)User speaks instead of typingWeb Speech API or VoskChat backendHandles conversation logicNode.js, Python FastAPI, etc.LLM API or local modelProvides the intelligenceOpenAI GPT API, or local models like LLaMA, Mistral, etc.Local hosting for avatar assetsSo you’re not streaming from a third partyHost .glb / .fbx files locally on your server

🖥️ 2. Hosting the Avatar Locally
If you want the avatar to be fully local (i.e., model files, animations, and lip-sync not dependent on cloud):


Choose or design your avatar:


Use a character from Ready Player Me, Blender, or Adobe Mixamo.


Export it as .glb or .fbx.




Serve the avatar file locally:


Put it in your web project’s public/models/avatar.glb folder.


Use a WebGL/Three.js scene to render it:
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load('/models/avatar.glb', (gltf) => {
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
});





Lip-syncing with speech:


Use a local speech-to-animation library like rhubarb-lip-sync.


Generate phoneme data for your TTS output and animate mouth blendshapes accordingly.





🧠 3. Adding Conversation Logic
You can integrate GPT-style AI in two ways:
Option A: Cloud-based AI (simpler)
Use OpenAI or Anthropic APIs for conversation:
const response = await fetch("/api/chat", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage }),
});

Then your backend calls the GPT API and returns text + voice.
Option B: Local AI (for full offline setup)
Run something like Ollama or LM Studio locally and query it from your backend:
ollama run mistral

Then in your Node/Python backend:
response = subprocess.run(["ollama", "run", "mistral"], input=user_message, text=True, capture_output=True)


🗣️ 4. Local Voice Generation
To give your avatar a voice offline:


Use Coqui TTS, Mimic 3, or piper (lightweight open-source models).


Generate .wav files from AI responses.


Play them in sync with the avatar mouth animation.


Example with Coqui TTS:
tts --text "Hello there" --out_path output.wav

🔒 7. Bonus: Privacy & Offline Options
If your goal is privacy and no cloud dependency, make sure:


All assets are in /public/.


Use local models for both LLM and TTS.


Serve over a local network using Nginx or Node.



Would you like me to generate a starter project (Next.js + Three.js + local avatar) for you?
I can create the base code for a working site that loads your local avatar and responds to text input.
